A sample of the receipt is mentioned on the right side for reference. Details to be entered include Store number, POS number and receipt number. Once entered, the system will retrieve the receipt details and the supervisor needs to select the item that needs to be returned from the receipt. Go to the return option in the POS machine, select, enter the amount correctly and should make sure that the POS machine is showing a negative amount. Scan the exchange deposit code and press total to get the exchange voucher / credit note.

This means that you cannot inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection.</p>
